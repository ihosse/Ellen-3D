# Ellen 3D - URP

It's a small third-person 3D game using visual and sound assets from the Unity 3D GameKit project.
- Original asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/unity-learn-3d-game-kit-115747

It was developed as an example for studying game programming in Unity. As the original asset was created using the built-in render pipeline, I updated some models to URP and redid all the gameplay code. This example is simpler than the original content because the idea is to provide an example of how to apply some Unity tools and programming strategies to a game prototype, such as:

- Cinemachine
- Starter Assets
- Input System
- Timeline
- Realtime Global Illumination
- Light Probes
- AI Navigation
- Unity Events
- State Pattern
- and more

Hope you enjoy!
